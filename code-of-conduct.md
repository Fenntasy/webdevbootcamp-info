# Code of conduct

## Don’t be a jerk

We are professionals, in a professional environment, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
- Personal insults, especially those using racist, sexist or body-shaming terms.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

## Be respectful

Remember that sexist, racist, body-shaming, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. If someone voices discomfort to something, listen to that person.

## Don’t assume ill intent

Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Conversely, we’re not here to win arguments, we should strive for mutual comprehension and if you feel that someones says something weird or shocking, ask for clarifications. Everyone has a different background and different knowledge, a disagreement should be viewed as a learning opportunity.

## What can you do if something feels wrong?

This is the counterpart of the other points, a problem is often simpler to address when it just occurred. If you feel safe, speak up. If not, tell someone you trust. If you don’t feel safe telling the teachers, it will be the responsibility of the one you entrusted to make it known to them, anonymously if you ask for it.
